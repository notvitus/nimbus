## How to use

To use/test this app, please follow these steps:

0. Make sure you have installed python.
   There are many tutorials online, I will not describe it here.

1. Download a version [above](#downloads).
   I highly recommend using the release version.

2. If you downloaded a zip file, follow these additional steps:

   1. Extract it somewhere.
      You should only need the `nimbus.py` and `requirements.txt` files.

   2. Install the requirements. This can be done using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
      Again, there are enough tutorials for this online, it won't be explained here.

3. Run the main file:

   - `nimbus.py`

   - `nimbus.exe`
